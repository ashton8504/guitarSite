# Rusch Guitar Project


## Description

The Rusch Guitar Project aims to redesign the website [ruschguitars.com](http://ruschguitars.com/) as a means to further knowledge on CSS, Bootstrap, HTML, design, and JavaScript. The primary objective is to showcase how these technologies can be used to enhance the visual appeal and functionality of a website.

## Project Steps

1. **Analyze**: Analyze the current website and identify its strengths and weaknesses. This will help understand what needs to be improved upon and what elements should be retained.

2. **Wireframe**: Plan and create a wireframe of the new design. This will give a visual representation of the website's layout and structure before implementation.

3. **CSS Styling**: Use CSS to style the website, including fonts, colors, images, and layout. Focus on creating a cohesive design that reflects the brand identity and is visually appealing.

4. **Bootstrap Responsive Layout**: Implement Bootstrap to create a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes. Ensure the website is accessible and easy to navigate on various devices.

5. **HTML Structure**: Use HTML to structure the content of the website, including headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Focus on creating a clear and concise layout that is easy to read and navigate.

6. **JavaScript Interactivity**: Use JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic features to the website, such as dropdown menus, image sliders, and contact forms. Enhance the user experience and make the website more engaging.

7. **Testing**: Test the website on various devices and browsers to ensure it is accessible, functional, and visually appealing.
