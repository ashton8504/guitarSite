          <p>"I cannot say enough about the positive experience I had regarding a custom setup and repair project I had. I built a custom guitar that needed some fine tuning to get it to where I needed it to be. I did the best I could building the guitar (it was my first guitar build). The neck needed to be cut down a fret, new springs in the Kahler tremelo and the neck needed to be reset w/ custom shims. Mr Rusch took the time to explain the scope of needed repair work, qouted a very reasonable price and proceeded to complete the project in a timely manor. I also know that the labor involved was much more extensive than originally anticipated, but Mr. Rusch only charged for the original quoted labor. The end result: I couldn't be more impressed and pleased with the entire experience. The guitar now plays great and Rusch Guitars has exceedeed my expectations. Thank you for your professional attitude, understanding and true craftsmanship."</p>

          <p>"Hey Rob,
            I got the wolf on friday evening and played it for a few and it sounds wonderful.  The action is beautiful, the color is beautiful. I brought it to band practice today and really wailed on it. She was screaming when she needed to and softly hummed on demand. This is the most incredible guitar I have ever put into my hands. You are so talented, you belong in guitar magazine. Im going to take my time to learn all the switches and tones, too much to try and figure out in an hour. My mom said it belongs in a museum or on the wall in a studio.  I love it rob!!!!! Thanks again brother!!! I want to stay in touch and see what else you got working on, like the purple & teal '59 Custom.. I'll chat with you tomorrow,. Im back on duty and on the desk. Thank you again brother."</p>

          <p>" I saw the guitar they now call "Wolf" for the first time, in the Spring of 1973 at a New Riders/Dead show. It was always my favorite, perhaps because it was the first truly custom guitar that I had seen. Fast forward almost 40 years, and I have my wonderful interpretation of the original "hippie sandwich" guitar by Robert Rusch. I own over 20 great guitars, but have not played any but this one in the week since it arrived. Good thing that I'm a collector, or I would be hard pressed to figure out what to do with the contents of my closet. The process of the build was almost as fun as having the guitar at home. You will have a real treat working with Robert. This guitar is easy to play, looks wonderful, but the sound is really amazing. I don't own another guitar with a more clear sound. That is the only way to describe it, clear, no crap at all. I've got instruments worth 10 times the cost of this one, and this is the finest. You will not go wrong with Rusch Guitars. Thanks, Robert."</p>
